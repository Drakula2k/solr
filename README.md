# hipsnip-solr

Chef cookbook for setting up Apache Solr from mirrors.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hipsnip-cookbooks/solr.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hipsnip-cookbooks/solr)

## Requirements

Built to run on Linux distributions. Tested on Ubuntu 12.04.
Depends on the `hipsnip-jetty` cookbook.

## Usage

By default the Jetty server setups thanks to the `hipsnip-jetty` cookbook set the port number to 8080, so do not forget to override `node[:jetty][:port]` in your role or env to run the Solr server on the port that you wish (reminder: the standard port for Solr is 8983).
Otherwise you should not need to override others attributes.

## Attributes

```
['solr']['version'] = "3.6.2"
# sha256 sum of the solr archive
['solr']['checksum'] = "537426dcbdd0dc82dd5bf16b48b6bcaf87cb4049c1245eea8dcb79eeaf3e7ac6"
# directory where solr archive is downloaded and extracted
['solr']['directory'] = "/usr/local/src"

# Guess by the cookbook if empty
['solr']['link'] = ""
['solr']['download'] = ""
['solr']['extracted'] = ""
['solr']['war'] = ""
['solr']['dist'] = ""

# location of solr (configuration files)
['solr']['home'] = "/usr/share/solr"
# location of the indexes
['solr']['data'] = "/usr/local/solr/data"

['solr']['context_path'] = '/solr'
['solr']['env_vars'] = {
	'solr.solr.home' => node['solr']['home'],
	'solr.data.dir' => node['solr']['data']
}

# SEVERE (highest value) WARNING INFO CONFIG FINE FINER FINEST (lowest value)
['solr']['log']['level'] = 'FINE'
['solr']['log']['class'] = 'java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler'
['solr']['log']['formatter'] = 'java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter'
```
## Cookbook development

You will need to do a couple of things to be up to speed to hack on this cookbook.
Everything is explained [here](https://github.com/hipsnip-cookbooks/cookbook-development) have a look.
