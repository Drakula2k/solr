# hipsnip-solr

Chef cookbook for setting up Apache Solr 3.6.x/4.x from mirrors.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hipsnip-cookbooks/solr.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hipsnip-cookbooks/solr)

## Requirements

Built to run on Linux distributions. Tested on Ubuntu 12.04.
Depends on the `hipsnip-jetty` cookbook.

## Usage

For example if you want to install Solr 4.2, you will have to edit the attributes as following:

```
attributes:
    solr:
      version: 4.2.1
      checksum: 648a4b2509f6bcac83554ca5958cf607474e81f34e6ed3a0bc932ea7fac40b99
    jetty:
      port: 8983
      version: 9.0.2.v20130417
      link: http://eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/jetty/stable-9/dist/jetty-distribution-9.0.2.v20130417.tar.gz&r=1
      checksum: 6ab0c0ba4ff98bfc7399a82a96a047fcd2161ae46622e36a3552ecf10b9cddb9
    java:
      jdk_version: 7
```

For more usage examples, read the configuration file of kitchen called `.kitchen.yml`. Each test suite describes a valid way to use this cookbook.
